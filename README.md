# Paks-special-portfolio

## Description

Pakapong Mongkol's professional portfolio/ resume is intended to provide a brief description of my skills, and past projects that I've worked on and a short (about me) section. Use the following contact info to contact me! Keep in mind the phone number is not operational, and the email is a spam email.

I was able to see a vision of how I wanted to have my portfolio and so googled ways to make it come true. References will be in the credit.
